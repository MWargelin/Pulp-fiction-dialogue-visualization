14,Young Man,False,Int. Coffee Shop,morning,I'm doin' fine.,3
15,Young Man,False,Int. Coffee Shop,morning,"I mean the way it is now, you're takin' the same fuckin' risk as when you rob a bank. You take more of a risk. Banks are easier! Federal banks aren't supposed to stop you anyway, during a robbery. They're insured, why should they care? You don't even need a gun in a federal bank. I heard about this guy, walked into a federal bank with a portable phone, handed the phone to the teller, the guy on the other end of the phone said: ""We got this guy's little girl, and if you don't give him all your money, we're gonna kill 'er.""",104
16,Young Woman,False,Int. Coffee Shop,morning,Did it work?,3
17,Young Man,False,Int. Coffee Shop,morning,"Fuckin' A it worked, that's what I'm talkin' about! Knucklehead walks in a bank with a telephone, not a pistol, not a shotgun, but a fuckin' phone, cleans the place out, and they don't lift a fuckin' finger.",38
18,Young Woman,False,Int. Coffee Shop,morning,Did they hurt the little girl?,6
19,Young Man,False,Int. Coffee Shop,morning,I don't know. There probably never was a little girl – the point of the story isn't the little girl. The point of the story is they robbed the bank with a telephone.,33
20,Young Woman,False,Int. Coffee Shop,morning,You wanna rob banks?,4
21,Young Man,False,Int. Coffee Shop,morning,"I'm not sayin' I wanna rob banks, I'm just illustrating that if we did, it would be easier than what we been doin'.",23

24,Young Woman,False,Int. Coffee Shop,morning,And no more liquor stores?,5
25,Young Man,False,Int. Coffee Shop,morning,"What have we been talking about? Yeah, no more-liquor-stores. Besides, it ain't the giggle it usta be. Too many foreigners own liquor stores. Vietnamese, Koreans, they can't fuckin' speak English. You tell 'em: ""Empty out the register,"" and they don't know what it fuckin' means. They make it too personal. We keep on, one of those gook motherfuckers' gonna make us kill 'em.",63
26,Young Woman,False,Int. Coffee Shop,morning,I'm not gonna kill anybody.,5
27,Young Man,False,Int. Coffee Shop,morning,"I don't wanna kill anybody either. But they'll probably put us in a situation where it's us of them. And if it's not the gooks, it these old Jews who've owned the store for fifteen fuckin' generations. Ya got Grandpa Irving sittin' behind the counter with a fuckin' Magnum. Try walkin' into one of those stores with nothin' but a telephone, see how far it gets you. Fuck it, forget it, we're out of it.",75

34,Young Woman,False,Int. Coffee Shop,morning,Here? It's a coffee shop.,5
35,Young Man,False,Int. Coffee Shop,morning,"What's wrong with that? People never rob restaurants, why not? Bars, liquor stores, gas stations, you get your head blown off stickin' up one of them. Restaurants, on the other hand, you catch with their pants down. They're not expecting to get robbed, or not as expecting.",47
36,Young Woman,False,Int. Coffee Shop,morning,I bet in places like this you could cut down on the hero factor.,14
37,Young Man,False,Int. Coffee Shop,morning,"Correct. Just like banks, these places are insured. The managers don't give a fuck, they're just tryin' to get ya out the door before you start pluggin' diners. Waitresses, forget it, they ain't takin' a bullet for the register. Busboys, some wetback gettin' paid a dollar fifty a hour gonna really give a fuck you're stealin' from the owner. Customers are sittin' there with food in their mouths, they don't know what's goin' on. One minute they're havin' a Denver omelet, next minute somebody's stickin' a gun in their face.",90
38,Young Man,False,Int. Coffee Shop,morning,"See, I got the idea last liquor store we stuck up. 'Member all those customers kept comin' in?",18
39,Young Woman,False,Int. Coffee Shop,morning,Yeah.,1

59,Vincent,False,Int. '74 Chevy (Moving),morning,"Yeah, it's legal, but is ain't a hundred percent legal. I mean you can't walk into a restaurant, roll a joint, and start puffin' away. You're only supposed to smoke in your home or certain designated places.",37
60,Jules,False,Int. '74 Chevy (Moving),morning,Those are hash bars?,4
61,Vincent,False,Int. '74 Chevy (Moving),morning,"Yeah, it breaks down like this: it's legal to buy it, it's legal to own it and, if you're the proprietor of a hash bar, it's legal to sell it. It's legal to carry it, which doesn't really matter 'cause – get a load of this – if the cops stop you, it's illegal for this to search you. Searching you is a right that the cops in Amsterdam don't have.",71

68,Jules,False,Int. '74 Chevy (Moving),morning,They don't call it a Quarter Pounder with Cheese?,9

100,Jules,False,Ext. Apartment Building Courtyard,morning,"Well, the way they pick the shows on TV is they make one show, and that show's called a pilot. And they show that one show to the people who pick the shows, and on the strength of that one show, they decide if they want to make more shows.

124,Jules,False,Int. Apartment Building Hallway,morning,"It ain't no ballpark either. Look maybe your method of massage differs from mine, but touchin' his lady's feet, and stickin' your tongue in her holyiest of holyies, ain't the same ballpark, ain't the same league, ain't even the same fuckin' sport. Foot massages don't mean shit.",47

547,Capt. Koons,False,Ext. Front Of Marsellus Wallace'S House,night,"This watch I got here was first purchased by your great-granddaddy. It was bought during the First World War in a little general store in Knoxville, Tennessee. It was bought by private Doughboy Ernie Coolidge the day he set sail for Paris. It was your great-granddaddy's war watch, made by the first company to ever make wrist watches. You see, up until then, people just carried pocket watches. Your great-granddaddy wore that watch every day he was in the war. Then when he had done his duty, he went home to your great- grandmother, took the watch off his wrist and put it in an ol' coffee can. And in that can it stayed 'til your grandfather Dane Coolidge was called upon by his country to go overseas and fight the Germans once again. This time they called it World War Two. Your great-granddaddy gave it to your granddad for good luck. Unfortunately, Dane's luck wasn't as good as his old man's. Your granddad was a Marine and he was killed with all the other Marines at the battle of Wake Island. Your granddad was facing death and he knew it. None of those boys had any illusions about ever leavin' that island alive. So three days before the Japanese took the island, your 22-year old grandfather asked a gunner on an Air Force transport named Winocki, a man he had never met before in his life, to deliver to his infant son, who he had never seen in the flesh, his gold watch. Three days later, your grandfather was dead. But Winocki kept his word. After the war was over, he paid a visit to your grandmother, delivering to your infant father, his Dad's gold watch. This watch. This watch was on your Daddy's wrist when he was shot down over Hanoi. He was captured and put in a Vietnamese prison camp. Now he knew if the gooks ever saw the watch it'd be confiscated. The way your Daddy looked at it, that watch was your birthright. And he'd be damned if and slopeheads were gonna put their greasy yella hands on his boy's birthright. So he hid it in the one place he knew he could hide somethin'. His ass. Five long years, he wore this watch up his ass. Then when he died of dysentery, he gave me the watch. I hid with uncomfortable hunk of metal up my ass for two years. Then, after seven years, I was sent home to my family. And now, little man, I give the watch to you.",427

1040,Winston,False,Ext. Monster Joe'S Truck And Tow,morning,"You hear that, young lady? Respect. You could lean a lot from those two fine specimens. Respect for one's elders shows character.",22
1041,Raquel,False,Ext. Monster Joe'S Truck And Tow,morning,I have character.,3
1042,Winston,False,Ext. Monster Joe'S Truck And Tow,morning,Just because you are a character doesn't mean you have character.,11
1043,Raquel,False,Ext. Monster Joe'S Truck And Tow,morning,"Oh you're so funny, oh you're so funny.",8

1051,Vincent,False,Int. Coffee Shop,morning,Why not?,2
1052,Jules,False,Int. Coffee Shop,morning,They're filthy animals. I don't eat filthy animals.,8
1053,Vincent,False,Int. Coffee Shop,morning,Sausages taste good. Pork chops taste good.,7
1054,Jules,False,Int. Coffee Shop,morning,"A sewer rat may taste like pumpkin pie. I'll never know 'cause even if it did, I wouldn't eat the filthy motherfucker. Pigs sleep and root in shit. That's a filthy animal. I don't wanna eat nothin' that ain't got enough sense to disregard its own feces.",47
1055,Vincent,False,Int. Coffee Shop,morning,How about dogs? Dogs eat their own feces.,8
1056,Jules,False,Int. Coffee Shop,morning,I don't eat dog either.,5
1057,Vincent,False,Int. Coffee Shop,morning,"Yes, but do you consider a dog to be a filthy animal?",12
1058,Jules,False,Int. Coffee Shop,morning,"I wouldn't go so far as to call a dog filthy, but they're definitely dirty. But a dog's got personality. And personality goes a long way.",26
1059,Vincent,False,Int. Coffee Shop,morning,"So by that rationale, if a pig had a better personality, he's cease to be a filthy animal?",18
1060,Jules,False,Int. Coffee Shop,morning,We'd have to be talkin' 'bout one motherfuckin' charmin' pig. It'd have to be the Cary Grant of pigs.,19

1067,Vincent,False,Int. Coffee Shop,morning,An act of God.,4
1068,Jules,False,Int. Coffee Shop,morning,What's an act of God?,5
1069,Vincent,False,Int. Coffee Shop,morning,"I guess it's when God makes the impossible possible. And I'm sorry Jules, but I don't think what happened this morning qualifies.",22
1070,Jules,False,Int. Coffee Shop,morning,"Don't you see, Vince, that shit don't matter. You're judging this thing the wrong way. It's not about what. It could be God stopped the bullets, he changed Coke into Pepsi, he found my fuckin' car keys. You don't judge shit like this based on merit. Whether or not what we experienced was an according-to-Hoyle miracle is insignificant. What is significant is I felt God's touch, God got involved.",69
1071,Vincent,False,Int. Coffee Shop,morning,But why?,2
1072,Jules,False,Int. Coffee Shop,morning,That's what's fuckin' wit' me! I don't know why. But I can't go back to sleep.,16

1076,Vincent,False,Int. Coffee Shop,morning,"So if you're quitting the life, what'll you do?",9
1077,Jules,False,Int. Coffee Shop,morning,"That's what I've been sitting here contemplating. First, I'm gonna deliver this case to Marsellus. Then, basically, I'm gonna walk the earth.",22
1078,Vincent,False,Int. Coffee Shop,morning,"What do you mean, walk the earth?",7
1079,Jules,False,Int. Coffee Shop,morning,"You know, like Caine in ""KUNG FU."" Just walk from town to town, meet people, get in adventures.",18
1080,Vincent,False,Int. Coffee Shop,morning,How long do you intend to walk the earth?,9
1081,Jules,False,Int. Coffee Shop,morning,Until God puts me where he want me to be.,10

1086,Vincent,False,Int. Coffee Shop,morning,"No Jules, you're gonna be like those pieces of shit out there who beg for change. They walk around like a bunch of fuckin' zombies, they sleep in garbage bins, they eat what I throw away, and dogs piss on 'em. They got a word for 'em, they're called bums. And without a job, residence, or legal tender, that's what you're gonna be – a fuckin' bum!",67

1178,Pumpkin,False,Int. Coffee Shop,morning,Not regularly.,2
1179,Jules,False,Int. Coffee Shop,morning,"There's a passage I got memorized. Ezekiel 25:17. ""The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of the darkness. For he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers. And you will know I am the Lord when I lay my vengeance upon you."" I been sayin' that shit for years. And if you ever heard it, it meant your ass. I never really questioned what it meant. I thought it was just a coldblooded thing to say to a motherfucker 'fore you popped a cap in his ass. But I saw some shit this mornin' made me think twice. Now I'm thinkin', it could mean you're the evil man. And I'm the righteous man. And Mr. .45 here, he's the shepherd protecting my righteous ass in the valley of darkness. Or is could by you're the righteous man and I'm the shepherd and it's the world that's evil and selfish. I'd like that. But that shit ain't the truth. The truth is you're the weak. And I'm the tyranny of evil men. But I'm tryin'. I'm tryin' real hard to be a shepherd.",242
1180,Jules,False,Int. Coffee Shop,morning,It's cold.,2
